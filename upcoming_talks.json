The capabilities of this stack can influence\napplication design from the ground up-database tables, all the way to\nthe final frameworks you might choose to use on the frontend, and not\nall of those repercussions are immediately clear from merely reading the\ndocumentation!</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we'll learn about some of the strengths of these modules\nand demonstrate how their capabilities can be leveraged to help you work\nfaster and write great web-based applications.</p>",
