      <title>Using Perl as a Command Line Tool</title>
      <presenter>Charles Bentley</presenter>
      <abstract>One of the places that Perl really shines is
         on the command line. Although most of the Perl code you write will
         live in programs, Perl makes it easy to solve quick problems with
         command line parameters. Chuck covers the most commonly needed command
         line options and some operators that are particularly useful in this

	 Although any <em>production</em> system would use a real web server

      <abstract>&lt;em&gt;Read the documentation&lt;/em&gt;, we&apos;re told, but there&apos;s always more to learn. When
I started working with Dancer2, DBIx::Class, and Template Toolkit last fall,
I&apos;d seen the basics, but I found out &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; quickly that there&apos;s much more to
learn. The capabilities of this stack can influence application design from the
ground up database tables, all the way to the final frameworks you might choose
to use on the frontend, and not all of those repercussions are immediately
clear from merely reading the documentation!

In this talk, we&apos;ll learn about some of the strengths of these modules and
demonstrate how their capabilities can be leveraged to help you work faster and
write great web-based applications.</abstract>
