      <title>Using Perl as a Command Line Tool</title>
      <presenter>Charles Bentley</presenter>
      <abstract>One of the places that Perl really shines is
         on the command line. Although most of the Perl code you write will
         live in programs, Perl makes it easy to solve quick problems with
         command line parameters. Chuck covers the most commonly needed command
         line options and some operators that are particularly useful in this

	 Although any <em>production</em> system would use a real web server

      <title>Getting gutsy with perl5</title>
      <presenter>Todd Rinaldo</presenter>
      <abstract>Todd Rinaldo has been working on the guts of Perl recently as part of the Perl
compiler project at cPanel. He began with some of the pre-requisites needed to
understand the presentation, including a basic understanding of C:

<ul>
    <li>structures</li>
    <li>unions</li>
    <li>arrays</li>
    <li>typedefs</li>
    <li>#define</li>
</ul>

He showed Nicolas Rochelemagne's talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNsew4U-quM"
target="blank">Introduction to Perl Internals</a> to give some background. Nicolas
covered some of the basics of Perl internal data structures and some information
about how perl handles memory.

After the video, Todd explained the <code>B::C</code> module and some of its
siblings.  He explained the difference between a stash and a pad, and talked
about how new pads are added each time you add a scope. Todd spent a little
more time discussing the internal data structures, mostly focusing on how they
relate to stashes and pads.

Next, he discussed how the parser doesn't actually generate an op-tree, as you might
guess from an study of compilers. Instead, it generates several op-trees, that are
linked together by entries in the stashes. He recommended spending time studying
