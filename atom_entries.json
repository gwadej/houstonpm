Once everyone arrives, we head inside\nfor the meeting at 6pm.</p>\n\n<p>This month, Ruth Holloway will present <em>Subtle Magic: Moving to Dancer2/DBIx::Class/TT</em>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Read the documentation\", we're told, but there's always more to learn. When\nI started working with Dancer2, DBIx::Class, and Template Toolkit last fall,\nI'd seen the basics, but I found out <em>very</em> quickly that there's much more to\nlearn. The capabilities of this stack can influence application design from the\nground up database tables, all the way to the final frameworks you might choose\nto use on the frontend, and not all of those repercussions are immediately\nclear from merely reading the documentation!</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we'll learn about some of the strengths of these modules and\ndemonstrate how their capabilities can be leveraged to help you work faster and\nwrite great web-based applications.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div>"
