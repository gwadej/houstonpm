    <p>This is the branch of the <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a>
    meeting in Houston, Texas. Perl Mongers is a loose association of
    international Perl User Groups. We discuss and educate people on the Perl
    programming language, as well as projects and modules written in Perl.</p>

    <p>We normally meet on the second Thursday of each month. The meeting officially
      starts at <time datetime="18:00">6pm</time> and runs until around <time datetime="20:00">8pm</time>.
      Meetings are open to the public.
      We don't have any dues, <em>official</em> membership, or anything like
      that. If you are interested in Perl, you are welcome to come.</p>

    <p>For some technical meetings, we meet in the lobby of the cPanel offices at
      <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/2550+N+Loop+W,+Houston,+TX+77092/@29.8081429,-95.4459714,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x8640c6fa4d91297b:0x988e2dedf77ce147">2550 North Loop West, Suite 4006, Houston, Texas 77092</a>,
      starting sometime between <time datetime="17:30">5:30pm</time> and <time datetime="18:00">6pm</time>. Once everyone arrives, we
      head upstairs to a conference room for the meeting.</p>

    <p>For other technical meetings, we meet in the lobby of the HostGator offices at
      <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=HostGator,+Houston&fb=1&gl=us&hq=HostGator,&hnear=0x8640b8b4488d8501:0xca0d02def365053b,Houston,+TX&cid=2141572779937723859&t=h&z=16&iwloc=A">5005 Mitchelldale St #100</a>,
      starting sometime between <time datetime="17:30">5:30pm</time> and <time datetime="18:00">6pm</time>. Once everyone arrives, we
      head inside for the meeting.</p>

    <p>We also have social meetings at some nearby restaurant or pub in some
      months if there is no topic for a technical meeting.</p>

    <p>Check the <a href="meetings.html">meetings</a> link for details.</p>

    <p>Our meeting attendance has always been highly variable. Recently,
     there have been 10-20 people at the meetings.</p>
