      <h2 class="subhead">Solving Wordbrain</h2>
      <p>Robert Stone presented this talk as a practice run for using this presentation
for a conference. He first described both <em>depth-first search</em> and
<em>breadth-first search</em>. This ensured that everyone was familiar with the
fundamentals for the solution techniques we will be exploring. </p>
      <p>Then, he described the game WordBrain and gave examples to clarify how the game
is played. The main points of the game are a set of letters, a given number of
words to find, and the number of letters in each of the target words. There are
no time limits. Hints can be requested. Unfortnately, we find that there may be
more than one set of words that meet the criteria supplied, but only one
answer.</p>
      <p>Robert showed how he used a standard search technique to generate all possible
word combinations from the gameboard. These potential solutions are filtered to
generate only actual solutions. The resulting solutions are formatted and
displayed to simplify testing the potential answers by entering them into the
program.</p>
      <p>He showed the code and explored many of the design decisions that he had made.
Since the code had run slower than he expected, he had turned to
<code>Devel::NYTProf</code> to determine the bottlenecks in the code. These
measurements lead to potential optimizations, which he discussed.</p>
      <p>The meeting quickly turned into a discussion of his coding decisions with different
suggestions on speed improvements. We discussed different approaches to limit the
depth of recursion and ways to more quickly recognize dead-ends. The group was
quite engaged in suggestions to help with performance.</p>
      <p>Robert has provided his materials for others to study, including
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="Solving_WordBrain.pptx">PowerPoint Slides</a></li>
  <li>the <a href="wordbrain.tar.gz">source code</a> for the solver</li>
</ul></p>
      <p>We had 11 people attending this month. As always, we'd like to thank
        HostGator, LLC for providing the meeting space and food for the group.</p>
