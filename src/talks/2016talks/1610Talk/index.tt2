      <h2 class="subhead">How Functional Programming Made Me Better at Perl</h2>
      <p>Mark Allen has been doing quite a bit of Erlang programming lately. This change
in language has caused him to become much more familiar with functional
programming topics. He contends (and proceeds to show) that learning functional
programming makes you a better programmer.</p>
      <p>Mark begins by mentioning some of the hallmark features of functional
programming, including:</p>

      <ul>
  <li>No side effects</li>
  <li>Explicit mutation of state</li>
  <li>Deterministic functions</li>
</ul>

      <p>Mark talks a bit about pure functions and describes how in a truly functional
program the order of operations does not matter.</p>
      <p>Mark goes on to demonstrate multiple concepts and standard functional operations
using examples from Erlang and OCaml.</p>
      <p>Once he has established these fundamentals, he spends some time showing some
equivalent functionality in Perl.</p>
      <p>Mark's <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mrallen1/functional-programming-made-me-a-better-perl-developer"

      <p>We had 12 people attending this month. As always, we'd like to thank
        HostGator, LLC for providing the meeting space and food for the group.</p>
