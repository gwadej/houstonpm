      <h2 class="subhead">Reconstructing an SQL injection from its fix</h2>
      <p>John Lightsey gives another of his security-related talks. In this instance, he
walks through a security fix on the Movable Type software. After demonstrating
the problematic code and showing how it can be exploited to answer arbitrary
yes/no questions about data in the database, he uses <code>sqlmap</code> to
automate actual effective attacks on a server he controls.</p>
      <p>We all know that SQL injection attacks are dangerous, but I think most of us
had a very simplistic view of what was possible. John showed how a relatively
small leak of information through a SQL injection could be used to query
information about the database and extract valuable information in an automated
fashion.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the <code>sqlmap</code> software is easily installable on
Debian. It can be used both to exploit a particular vulnerability or as a fuzzer
to find vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>After the main demonstration, John gave a set of other resources in the same
area.</p>

      <p>We had 9 people attending this month. As always, we'd like to thank
