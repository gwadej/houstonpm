      <h2 class="subhead">Introduction to ASN.1 BER Encoding</h2>
      <p>Although <acronym title="Abstract Syntax Notation One">ASN.1</acronym> and
<acronym title="Basic Encoding Rules">BER</acronym> are lower-level than many
of our recent talks, Chris did a really good job of covering the subject in a
way that everyone could understand. The questions from the audience were
handled well and everyone seemed to be following the topic.</p>
      <p>Near the end, the discussion turned to releasing his code on CPAN and potential
alternate implementations. Chris pointed out that there are other
implementations already on CPAN and most of his coding had been in service of
learning and understanding.</p>
      <p>Chris has made his <a
      href="http://despertargz.github.io/ber/">presentation</a> available
      on-line. His presentation and supporting code are <a
      href="https://github.com/despertargz/BerDecoder.git">available</a> on
      github.</p>
      <p>We had 8 people attending this month. As always, we'd like to thank
        HostGator, LLC for providing the meeting space and food for the group.</p>
