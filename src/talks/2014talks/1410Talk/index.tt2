      <h2 class="subhead">A Clear Text Explanation of the AES Cipher</h2>
      <p>Robert explained that he is implementing <code>Crypt::Rijndael::PP</code> as a
pure Perl implementation of the algorithm selected as the <acronym
title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</acronym> by <acronym
title="National Institute of Standards and Technology">NIST</acronym>.</p>
      <p>In this presentation, Robert walked us through a history of the AES. Then, he
proceeded through a high-level description of how the algorithm works. He
dipped into implementation details where they weren't too overwhelming. He finished
the talk with a discussion of some weaknesses that have been found since
Rijndael was selected as the AES.</p>
      <p>Since this was an extremely technical talk, Robert had to walk a fine line between
too much detail and too high-level a description. He managed this quite well,
as was shown be a number of really good questions after the talk. The group
discussed the presentation and asked quite a few questions afterwards. Even as
most of the group left, several people remained for more hard-core discussion
that included delving into implementation details and suggestions for improving
the implementation when it is converted to C/XS.</p>
      <p>Robert also provided some resources if you want to dig into this topic
         further.</p>
