      <h2 class="subhead">Julian in the land of NoSQL</h2>

      <p>Julian Brown had a web project he was working on that manipulated a list
of <em>recipes</em>. Where each recipe has a description and a list of steps.
The front-end was to be implemented in Angular. That part handles the routing,
templating and such.
The original version used a SQLite backend, and rendered using Perl CGI.</p>
      <p>A later version was construccted in C++, using the jsoncpp library for the
<abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> part of the application.
The libcurl library was used for network access. The final piece of the puzzle
was replacing SQLite with the ArangoDB NoSQL database.</p>
      <p>The code for the project was written in C++ 11. It used <abbr title="ArangoDB Query Language">AQL</abbr>
to access the database. Authorization was handled through a session ID and
secret. ArangoDB uses the concept of <em>collections</em> instead of tables.
<abbr title="ArangoDB Query Language">AQL</abbr> supports bind parameters, which
helps to avoid injection. The server did seem very sensitve to available RAM.</p>
      <p>Julian did point out that he did learn about some drawbacks of JSON-encoded
NoSQL. The biggest one seemed to be duplication of the data.</p>
      <p>This was an interesting talk that generated several questions from the audience.</p>
      <p>We had 9 people attending this month. As always, we'd like to thank
        HostGator, LLC for providing the meeting space and food for the group.</p>
