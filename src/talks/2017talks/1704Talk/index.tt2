      <p>Todd Rinaldo talked about the p5hack meeting last year in Amsterdam. He began
with some history leading up to the meeting.</p>
      <p>Some of the initial plans were to have a (relatively) small number of people
to be able to make decisions, to include contributors to the p5p group and to
have a plan beforehand to make certain something is accomplished. The meeting
was hosted by Booking.com at the Amsterdam headquarters starting on Nov. 11, 2016.</p>

      <p>Todd and JD described some of the major topics, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>finalizing a real deprecation policy including dates for removal of deprecated features</li>
        <li>Stevan Little's research into a protocol for objects in Perl</li>
        <li>Changes to <code>B::C</code>
        <li>Removing <code>.</code> from <code>@INC</code>
        <li>Changing the <code>O</code> module to not load modules it doesn't need</li>
        <li>Removal of 2-arg <code>open</code>s throughout code modules</li>
      </ul>
      <p>He also discussed some other smaller topics. See the full report for all topics.</p>
      <p>We had 12 people attending this month. As always, we'd like to thank
        HostGator, LLC for providing the meeting space and food for the group.</p>
