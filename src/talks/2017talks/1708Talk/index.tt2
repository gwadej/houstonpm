      <h2 class="subhead">Gray-ish Hat Adventures In Automating Mobile Game Play: Why Tap When You Could Automate?</h2>
      <p>Robert began with a demo of the game, followed by a brief discussion about
the structure of apk packages used to install games on Android.  After this
we searched the apk for specific strings such as "login" in order to find
where the interesting parts were and used dotPeek to decompile them.  This
showed us that the game was using websockets for communication,
specifically socket.io.</p>
      <p>Armed with the mechanism of communication, Robert showed how we could use
Charles Proxy and Proxycap to man in the the middle the game's network
traffic.  Once the structure of the communications was uncovered we had a
brief discussion of the format of the data as well as some key assumptions
the game makes which makes it less then secure at times.</p>
      <p>We wrapped up with a demonstration of the game being played by the scripts
in real time, a discussion of the advantages of using Moo over Moose at
times, and then a group discussion about how the automation could be
expanded.</p>
      <p>We had 8 people attending this month. As always, we'd like to thank
        HostGator, LLC for providing the meeting space and food for the group.</p>
